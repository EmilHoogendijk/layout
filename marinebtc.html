				<h1>How blockchain technology is stirring the waters for the shipping trade</h1>

				<p>The world’s marine industry giants have long been regarded as conservative, set in their ways and resistant to change. Yet, if recent blockchain-related developments are anything to go by, it seems nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

				<p>In many parts of the world, shipping is seen as an industry on the decline. However, some say, blockchain pilot schemes are now helping breathe new life into the marine trade.</p>
				
				<p>But where exactly does blockchain come into the shipping equation?</p>

				<p>Well, for a start, it could help resolve eliminate document fraud cases and potentially reduce the need for costly dispute arbitration. In an industry plagued by fake agents, fake documents and even fake goods, blockchain’s immutable ledger system has the potential to kick fraud into touch for good.</p>

				<p>In fact, when you think about it, cargo tracking is actually a fairly intuitive use for the blockchain. Maersk, the world’s biggest container ship and supply vessel operator, claimed back in 2014 that intercontinental shipments often require “mountains” of paperwork, with “processes involving nearly 30 people and organizations,” and comprising “up to 200 different interactions.” With blockchain technology, however, Maersk says it will be able to ditch paper documentation altogether and allow all parties to participate in an immutable digital ledger system instead.</p>

				<p>Indeed, developments like these could, in theory, allow every party involved in the process to check on the status of a shipment at any point in the process – representing a very serious upgrade in both reliability and efficiency.</p>
